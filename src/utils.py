# It's a common place for functionalities where entire function of the Project can be imported from 
# It is a common Python file in ML projects that contains utility/helper functions used across multiple modules.
# Purpose: A centralized file for reusable functions that don't belong to any specific component but are needed everywhere.
# Think of it as: Your project's toolbox ðŸ§°
